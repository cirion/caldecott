Turmoil rocked the exclusive world of San Francisco megacorps as the year drew to a close. Shiawase, the oldest and most venerated megacorp on the planet, suddenly appeared vulnerable, and its competitors wasted no time seizing their assets and market share. The Marines were forced to maintain order in the wake of the widespread infighting, which in turn led to a welcome respite for orks and other metahumans living in the East Bay.

That period of peace proved short-lived. The Japanese Diet lost faith in Saito's ability to protect their interests after his failure to defend Shiawase from a small team of shadowrunners, and in 2061 they ordered him to return to the homeland. Saito refused, naming himself Protectorate General and launching his long-planned invasion of California.

The fighting was brutal and one-sided, but the runners had denied Saito the doomsday weapon he craved: they thoroughly wiped out Hemlock, along with anyone who might restart the project. The General's assault was still brutal and the death toll high, but the nightmarish scenario of biological mass genocide never came to pass.

Between Shiawase's fall from grace and Saito's war, the metahumans of Oakland and the surrounding cities united in preparation for the worst. Saito seized Sacramento and established the California Protectorate, but the fighting in the East Bay never stopped. The General's grand ambitions of controlling a powerful state that could rival UCAS fell apart as he became mired in an endless insurgency at the heart of his would-be empire.

And what of the runner who destroyed Hemlock and thwarted Saito's grand plan? Nobody seemed to know precisely where they went next, but when one traveled in resistance circles, they quickly learned that this runner was admired above all others in the annals of the struggle. The Hero of Halferville, the Savior of Orks, the Shield of Oakland: these titles expressed the people's gratitude, and served as a warning to their foes. This runner had bent the arc of history, walking in the shadows so others might live in the light.
