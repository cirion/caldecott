  text: "I ended up backing out of that plan, since it would have required me making a much bigger map than I was prepared to tackle. Instead it morphed into the Elorn recruitment mission, with a more typical combat focus against the Native Californians.

Players with social builds will have an easier time convincing people to do what they want."
