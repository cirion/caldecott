If you happen to bring a decker along on this mission, and happen to jack in, and dutifully return to the entrance for a proper jack-out (rather than terminating early), you\'ll be treated to a (probably) unexpected appearance from Hestaby, the great dragon of Shasta."

  text: "I\'ve gotten in the habit of sprinkling little nuggets like this through my campaigns. It\'s a way of planting seeds for potential sequels. I have no idea if there will be any follow-up, and if so whether they\'ll follow up on any of these ideas, but if one does materialize, I\'ll have some material to work with. It\'s nice to provide some hooks for existing fans to get into later stories, and also retroactively improves the earlier work by tying it into a longer continuity."

  text: "Hestaby is one of the more obvious hooks. Sable\'s conversations about Hitomi offer another. There\'s the People\'s University matrix node to consider. And, of course, Dorbi seems to have big plans.\n\nAgain, though, there\'s no guarantee that any of this will come to pass. In Antumbra Saga, some of my early seeds bore fruit (spirits, the recording contract, Tir agents, Norton). Others haven\'t (Aztechnology, nanites). So I\'m always careful to avoid promising any specific resolutions in upcoming content. I want to write whatever story ends up being most compelling, not something I promised on a whim two years ago."
