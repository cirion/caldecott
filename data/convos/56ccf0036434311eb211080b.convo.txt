  text: "Every once in a while, my narrative goals clash with my gameplay goals. Dorbi is pulling her weight here, fighting off hordes of ravening monsters and setting off a huge earthquake. It\'s kind of an awesome sequence for her, as her raw power literally reshapes the world. But it\'s also been a major pain point for players: she\'s off on her own, without any support, and thus very vulnerable to the foes she faces."

  text: "As a side note: in my original draft, you needed to assign your crew members to different tasks prior to starting the heist. Rafik, in particular, could be put on the train (providing you with backup but increasing your Suspicion), in the caves (providing valuable support to Dorbi), or back at home (no real benefit, it just ticked him off). I eventually decided that it was overly complicated and didn\'t make things much more fun, so he was permanently put on train duty. Placing him with Dorbi could have made this sequence more bearable, though that would have kind of screwed over the player character if you got in a firefight. Ultimately, if someone is going to screw up your quest, I\'d rather have it be Dorbi than yourself."
