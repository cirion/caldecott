  text: "As with several characters in the campaign, I wanted to establish Ava enough in the early sections that you would recognize her and have an idea of who she is, but not focus on her so much that you would necessarily anticipate her being a primary villain. Here, she\'s giving a seemingly-boring speech about the ongoing initiatives of Shiawase California. If you\'ve played through the campaign before, though, you may pick up on a couple of oblique references to her ongoing research project."

  text: "As someone who has worked for and with corporations, I have a hard time swallowing the \"faceless boundless evil\" vibe that they give off in most cyberpunk literature. Corporations are made up of people, just like you and the people you know. There are bright, compassionate, funny people working everywhere. I wanted to express some of that in my campaign. Shiawase isn\'t a single entity: it\'s an institution, made up of many different parts, each one with its own story."

  text: "However, I think corporations do have a major flaw: they are a mechanism for absolving responsibility. Particularly in the Western world, they lead to situations where evil is done, not because some madman is pushing the world towards destruction, but because each person thinks that someone else demands it."

  text: "Think of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, where the company deliberately sold grossly-polluting vehicles to consumers, deceiving them and regulators about the environmental impact. The engineer who programmed the \"defeat device\" was told to do so: it was his or her job, not a decision they made. Their manager was just passing down orders from higher up. The ultimate decision-makers in the executive suite and on the board were trying to maximize shareholder value. And people who own stock in Volkswagen never intended to cause more pollution. It\'s plausible that every single person in that chain of command thought that they were a good, virtuous person; but no person had overall responsibility, and the world is a worse place as a result."

  text: "That\'s how I picture Ava\'s personal arc. Is she a villain? Yes, but not in the same way that Claude or Kroin are. Those two have a strong vision of how the world should be, and act to bring it into reality. Ava just sees herself as a cog in a machine. She doesn\'t set policy. She carries out orders. And yet, the harm that she causes could be far greater than that done by the Native Californians or the Halferville Protection Front. Ava has the resources of a megacorp at her disposal, and if she can align misery with profit, then untold misery will result."
