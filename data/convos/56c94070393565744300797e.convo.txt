  text: "As with several characters in the campaign, I wanted to establish Ava enough in the early sections that you would recognize her and have an idea of who she is, but not focus on her so much that you would necessarily anticipate her being a primary villain. Here, she\'s giving a seemingly-boring speech about the ongoing initiatives of Shiawase California. If you\'ve played through the campaign before, though, you may pick up on a couple of oblique references to her ongoing research project."

  text: "As someone who has worked for and with corporations, I have a hard time swallowing the \"faceless boundless evil\" vibe that they give off in most cyberpunk literature.
