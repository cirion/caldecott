  text: "Veterans of Antumbra Saga will recognize the Native Californians, one of the enemy factions near the end of that campaign. Your runner in that game tangled with them several times, but never defeated their leader, so I decided to bring them back in Caldecott so you could get closure to their unpleasant story."

  text: "I struggled a bit with the terminology. \"Native Californian\" is their canonical name, as given in the California Free State source book. However, the phrase isn\'t used elsewhere in the Shadowrun setting, and I was worried that players would confuse them with Ohlone or other Native American tribal members."

  text: "I consulted with the /r/Shadowrun subreddit, who provided some helpful thoughts on how to introduce them. I ended up keeping the name, but adding dialogue with NPCs who explicitly explain that these aren\'t NAN members, but rather a homegrown equivalent to Humanis. Dragonfall did a great job at introducing Humanis, so I think most players of this campaign will understand the NC\'s agenda and methods."
