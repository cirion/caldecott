  text: "I tried to mitigate this in a few ways. Booby traps are presented consistently: every time you see a blinking red light, it means there\'s a booby trap there. You may remember seeing a blinking red light immediately before you died in the first scene, so there\'s a precedence for the \"blinky explosion\" association."

  text: "Booby traps affect both you and enemies. If you let the NC invade the station, you\'ll see one fighter blow himself up when he charges into the one by the door. And the drone will typically trigger the one in the hall when it flies towards you. Hopefully, this helps it feel like fair play, rather than the designer being out to get you."

  text: "Ideally, this will end up feeling like a bit of a puzzle. You\'ll run into the first one, and be briefly surprised and upset at the damage. But you\'ll make the association between the stimulant and the outcome. You\'ll be able to verify your hypothesis with the second trap, and be ready to solve the third once it appears. No single trap should be devastating, but you\'ll feel a sense of accomplishment at overcoming the later instances."
