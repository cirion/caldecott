A big part of why I started work on Caldecott in the first place is because I wanted to try my hand at writing my own romance story.\n\nThat said, I was pretty nervous about it. I\'ve never written romance before in any medium, and being an avid consumer of something does not make you an expert in it."

  text: "Compounding this, I knew that a lot of Shadowrun fans are rabidly anti-romance. During the Kickstarter, whenever someone would bring up the *idea* of romance, they would immediately get dogpiled by people complaining about how love has no place inside Shadowrun. Which made me sad - I like romance, and like Shadowrun, and would like more of both. I was more resolved than ever to take a swing at it, but also was cognizant of the fact that many potential players would want nothing to do with those stories."

  text: "I ended up adapting an idea from Fallout: New Vegas. In that game, you could spend perk points to unlock new abilities, some of which would allow you to flirt with one or more preferred genders. I really liked that approach - it\'s a way for the player to proactively declare their interest or lack thereof in romance, and to do so in a system integrated within the game, rather than through an external toggle or something."

  text: "In Caldecott, by default, any character can flirt with anyone. During an early conversation with Rafik, though, you\'re given an opportunity to express your preference, or lack thereof. Based on this, I can close off one or both of the romance options.\n\nOf course, this doesn\'t oblige you to pursue a romance. I was very careful to always keep the romance optional. In fact, if I wasn\'t happy with how the romance turned out, I was prepared to remove that element from the game altogether, so I needed to make sure that the story still made sense without it."

  text: "I am very indebted to David Gaider, a former head writer at BioWare, for an excellent series of blog posts in which he described the behind-the-scenes system that he has used for romances he has written. I couldn\'t really use it as-is for this campaign, since the rhythm of a Shadowrun game doesn\'t offer the same level of freedom as the BioWare RPGs do, but it was invaluable for identifying the core elements of an engaging romance and helping the player buy in to the story.\n\nI also highly recommend his GDC talk \"Sex in Video Games\", a fascinating and often-amusing look at his long record of successes and failures in video-game romance."

  text: "One of the things that I think most helps the romance feel engaging is the frequent affirmation required of the player. It takes regular work on your part to initiate the romance, and there are multiple opportunities along the way to call it off. This prevents players from feeling like they\'re \"forced into\" the romance, but more importantly, it requires them to be active participants in it, which I think helps increase the sense of attachment. Much as in real life, the bond goes stronger the more you affirm it."

  text: "There is still one dangling problem with the romance: players who have started it may not \"finish\" in time for it to be acknowledged. I want the romance to feel somewhat natural, and so there are time limitations. You can only speak so many times with a person between missions; it would feel really weird to start flirting with someone right before the end, then immediately run through all of their romance content. It\'s much more realistic to have the bond slowly develop over time, as you pass through the phases of flirting, \"dating\", and cementing your relationship."

  text: "The problem, though, is that if players don\'t always speak with their partner between missions, they may fall behind. Worse, they may *think* that they\'re pursuing the romance, but not encounter all of the dialogs.\n\nAfter receiving some early feedback from people who were confused that the romance seemed to peter out and not be acknowledged, I restructured the romance dialogs. Previously, the dialogue would terminate at the end of each \"lovetalk\". That works well for dramatic purposes, since they tend to end on strong notes. Now, though, you\'ll loop back to the the main conversational hub after each lovetalk. This makes it much easier to see if there are additional lovetalks available, which should make it harder to accidentally fall behind in a romance."

  text: "That change has diminished the risks of broken romances, but it\'s still a possibility. To help mitigate that a little, I\'ve added some dialogue to the very last scene of the game, where a partially-romanced character will acknowledge their status. This provides a little bit of closure to players, and also provides a fairly strong in-universe hint that they may get a different outcome if they re-play the game and pursue the romance more zealously."

  text: "As far as the content of the romances: structurally, they follow the exact same path, with the same number of flirts, same number of lovetalks, a capstone quest. But I wanted to make sure that each romance internally felt different, and their dialogue reflects their different personalities.\n\nThis is probably most obvious in their capstone quests. Persi is very individualistic, and her quest is an elaborate ruse to get you by yourself. Sable is much more outgoing and collaborative, and he enlists the whole team in a celebration of your relationship. Mechanically, they\'re the same (run around, find an item, be surprised by a romance scene), but they feel unique."

  text: "One interesting thing I discovered while writing the romance scenes was that accommodating different metatypes was *much* more challenging than accommodating both genders. Writing something as simple as \"you kiss her\" becomes difficult when \"you\" can be either a four-foot dwarf or an eight-foot troll, and your target is a six-foot ork. Are you getting up on a stepladder to reach her lips? Or bending down to reach her?\n\nFor any sort of physical interaction, I would need to run through the different potential variations of the player character. It ended up becoming a really fun challenge: instead of writing different text for each possible metatype, I came up with situations that would make sense in each configuration. And so, for example, you start kissing AFTER you\'re both down on the floor and height isn\'t such an issue any more."

As a romance fan myself, I\'ve been guilty in the past of complaining online when I\'ve been unhappy with romance options or content in a game, and I was expecting to get a lot of similar complaints for this campaign; I\'d even psyched myself up, deciding that it would be a form of karma for my past words. However, people have been really complimentary! That makes me feel great, and is also encouraging me to continue including romance in future projects."
