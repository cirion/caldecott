  text: "I\'m pretty proud of the three-dimensional look of the map, where you can move higher and lower along terraced hills. That\'s VERY challenging to do in an isometric engine, and took a lot of fiddling to get right.\n\nBehind the scenes, the Shadowrun engine only allows movement along ground tiles with 0 elevation. So, while it looks like the upper level is higher than the lower, as far as the game engine is concerned, they\'re at the same height. But the rest of the walls, cliffs, furniture, etc. are located higher, so you can see proper perspective shifts while panning the camera. I essentially wallpapered over some ugly seams, ending up with a decent approximation of a hillside."

  text: "In my original vision, the climactic battle of Antumbra Saga took place on the peak of Mount Shasta. Facing the overwhelming might of Tir Tairngire\'s army, your forces would be forced to retreat higher and higher up, until there was nowhere left to go.\n\nIt was a nice idea in theory, but, as I discovered during my prototyping phase, isometric engines are horrible at communicating the gradually sloped terrain that would be required to depict a mountain. So, I reluctantly switched gears and changed the story to end in the caverns instead of the mountaintop."

  text: "Fortunately, the Berkeley Hills are a bit more amenable to this art style than Mount Shasta. It\'s been heavily shaped by man, rather than nature, so right angles and excavations are reasonable to portray. I love feeling like I\'ve won a victory over a technical limitation."
