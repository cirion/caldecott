  text: "Heh... this is one of the few places where I ignored a strong recommendation from my alpha tester. He thought that it felt broken to get such a crazy-large payout, more than you could reasonably spend. I kind of deliberately wanted it to feel strange, though. I\'m a bit tired of constantly playing games where I\'m embarking on some huge, important, epic quest, but need to pinch my pennies to buy enough ammunition for my team. Why *not* give you unlimited resources heading into the final fight? I thought it would be a nice change to be able to buy all of the toys you could possibly want, and since it\'s so late in the game, I wasn\'t especially concerned about it becoming imbalanced."

  text: "I think I mentioned this before, but I think this scene is especially poignant if you decided to sacrifice your companion. You started organizing this heist in order to earn money, after all. Now, you have more money than you know what to do with... but may have lost the person who meant the most to you. There\'s a bitter hollowness to that scenario which I find compelling."

  text: "Initially, I\'d planned for this scene to be more frenetic, as you rush forward towards the true climax. I ended up slowing it down a bit to be more like a typical hub, and in particular added dialogues with your crew members. They aren\'t quite as long or in-depth as the early ones, but I wanted to reinforce the sense that your actions will affect people beyond yourself. Also, since there isn\'t much story left, I wanted to make sure that it felt like there were still meaningful stakes and choices to make. Your companions feel personally invested in what happens next, and this is a good opportunity to be reminded of their priorities."
