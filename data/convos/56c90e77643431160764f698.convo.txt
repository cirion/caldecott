  text: "I took advantage of the environment to portray this situation. You can\'t talk with many people inside here, but just walking through it tells a story, one which contrasts with the grand hall you\'ve left behind. The main hall of Halferville looks elegant, well-crafted, and has many people happily chatting with one another and confidently striding around. Those people are all dwarves."

  text: "In contrast, the slums here are populated by offcasts, primarily orks and trolls. They aren\'t receiving the same level of care and attention that the dwarves in the main hall are. There\'s a more visible law enforcement presence, but the cops give the impression of being here to protect the majority from the poor, not to protect the poor."

  text: "Kroin is an obvious example of a dwarf who works to keep the \"trogs\" down, while Kora and her friends want to improve their situation. But the vast majority of Halferville residents just silently accept the status quo. They probably don\'t think of themselves as hateful people, but they benefit from a system tilted in their favor, and do not try to repair it. I find myself hoping that, much like the player, they will realize how wrong this is and do their part to build a fairer society."
