  text: "Mechanically, the fight is structured to reward players who successfully stealthed their way through the ship. Instead of needing to fight off the commandos all by themselves, they end up in a three-way firefight, with their enemies whittling each other down. And, if you continue to avoid drawing the attention of the guards, you\'ll find it easier still."

  text: "I\'ve tweaked the dialogue a bit since the initial release, in response to the helpful feedback I\'ve received. I think it\'s less confusing now, though in retrospect it\'s something I probably should have developed more fully. It\'s one of those things that was clear in my head but didn\'t translate very well to the game."
