  text: "Unlike Claude, you do have the option of talking with Zielor and coming to an agreement, even persuading him to join your side. However, this isn\'t necessarily the \"best\" outcome. Once again, moral ambiguity is more interesting to me. Ideally, you\'ll examine your conscience, and that of your character, before deciding whether you feel comfortable accepting his offer."

  text: "If you\'ve consistently thwarted the MPA, then he\'s unwilling to trust you and you\'re forced into a fight. I\'ve tried to imply via dialogue that this isn\'t a foregone conclusion, and different choices might have led to different outcomes.\n\nIf you\'re consistently sided with them, he\'ll sheepishly acknowledge that he has been wrong about you and easily join.\n\nMost players will probably end up in the middle. This keeps the possibility of an alliance open, but puts the burden on the player. You\'ll need appropriate social skills or meaningful concessions to bring him on board."
