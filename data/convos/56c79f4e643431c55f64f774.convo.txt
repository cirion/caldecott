  text: "I switched that up more in The Caldecott Caper. Most of the teammates here are essentially \"dual-classed\". Sable, as a Decker/Melee hybrid, is one of the more extreme examples. This approach is more feasible thanks to the addition of the crew advancement system, which lets you guide your NPCs\' development. If your PC is a decker, you\'ll probably want Sable to focus on his fighting skills; otherwise, you may build him as a decker. That way, he\'ll have at least some use regardless of your player character\'s build. At the same time, it also helps protect against the risk of an NPC overshadowing your PC."

  text: "I had a lot of fun with all of my characters\' voices, and Sable was no exception. He\'s endlessly curious, generally optimistic, and dangerously open-minded. He\'s the chattiest member of your party, constantly asking questions and chiming in with random thoughts. Like most of your crew, he doesn\'t have a strong moral compass, but he genuinely likes people and can be quite charming."
