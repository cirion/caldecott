  text: "And here is the supposed climax to the mod!\n\nThere\'s some interesting choice-and-consequence at play. Various decisions that you\'ve made throughout the campaign may come back to help or haunt you. Behind the scenes, I\'m using a point-based system that raises the alarm. This can be incremented either as a result of things that have happened in the past (alerting Shiawase about your activities), or in the present (acting suspiciously / aggressively as you progress through the train)."

  text: "I wanted players to feel like their choices had an impact, but I also wanted to discourage metagaming. For example, if you spare a Native Californian who surrenders during the engine-acquisition run, he\'ll spread the word and raise the alarm. Choosing to let him go will make your job more difficult, but by itself it doesn\'t doom you to going loud.\n\nIt\'s possible to get through the train quietly, even if you made all of the \"wrong\" decisions, so long as your character has the required skills. Conversely, you can get through the train quietly with NONE of the required skills, so long as you\'ve made all of the \"right\" decisions. In practice, players will probably have a mixture of both, and hopefully there will be some tension as they progress."

  text: "In a side note - this sequence was very loosely inspired by Snowpiercer, though of course it\'s a very pale imitation. If I had art skills and unlimited time, there would be a lot more cars to go through and much more varied decor. As it stands, though, there is still a similar \"social climb\" metaphor, from the initial car filled with peons, through the consumerist middle-class car, through the wealthy executive car, and finally into the center of power."
