  text: "The situation in the bar is a pretty typical example. You need to find a way down below. If you have the appropriate etiquette or charisma, this is fairly straightforward. Otherwise, you will need to pay some nuyen, or else spend more time exploring the bar. Not having the \"right\" etiquettes may feel like a setback, but one that you can quickly recover from."

  text: "Incidentally, there are some interesting schools of thought around the use of skills. As RPG players, we\'ve been conditioned to expect that, whenever we see an option unlocked by an ability, it will lead to the best outcome and we should always select it. That\'s good in that it gives players a sense of reward; but in narrative-heavy games, it can discourage role-playing and keep players from actually thinking about their decisions."

  text: "Some of my favorite recent games, like Sunless Sea and Fallen London, deliberately subvert this trope. In those games, selecting a challenging choice that you have worked hard to unlock can often produce the *worst* possible outcome! That\'s always initially surprising and frustrating, but when I think back over the text, the result always makes sense. If I\'d stopped to think about what my character was doing, I could have predicted that something bad would happen."
