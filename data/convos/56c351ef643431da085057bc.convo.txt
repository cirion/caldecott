  text: "An early scripted scene. After making Antumbra Saga, I\'ve learned to be cautious about these. Each new update of the editor and engine has a high risk of breaking scripts like this, which can leave players unable to advance until I release a fix.\n\nThat said, cut-scenes can be powerful tools, so I try to deploy them at crucial story beats.

  text: "This particular scene was tricky to get right and required a lot of iteration. The game engine behaves strangely when your main character is incapacitated, so I had to hack a few things: teleporting your character off the camera, switching player control, and so on.\n\nIt works, but if the scene lasted any longer, Rafik would become the main character!"
