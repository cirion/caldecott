  text: "I have several advantages when it comes to pulling off a twist, not least of which is that this is a user-created mod, and so there\'s less of an expectation about how long it will be. Plenty of great user-created campaigns are an hour or so long, so this already seems like a perfectly reasonable place to end."

  text: "I\'ve also taken advantage of a lot of the mechanics of the game, subtly reinforcing the idea that things are coming to an end. There are only 4 levels of crew progression visible, and you\'ve already reached the limit, so it seems like the story must be finished. There\'s victory music playing, all of the shops are closed, there are no outstanding side-missions... everything seems to indicate that the game is coming to an end."

  text: "At the same time, I\'ve tried to narratively seed the twist. Kroin has been very up-front all along about his dislike of orks and trolls. There have been multiple references to Shiawase\'s big research project. The various metahuman resistance groups are fighting against the increasingly-active Imperial Marine and Native Californian factions."

  text: "But, I think the key is that all of that stuff has been implied to be background information: flavor text, motivations, padding. It isn\'t until this moment that, suddenly, all of those abstract ideas become alarmingly concrete. The political becomes personal, and you\'re thrust into the final act as the background rushes to the foreground."

  text: "Writing a twist is always challenging. If you make it too obvious, people will see it coming from a mile away, and will get annoyed at how predictable it is. If you fail to plant enough clues, though, then it can feel confusing or unfair, in the same way than an unbalanced fight would seem unfair."

  text: "I think that this dichotomy between mechanics and narrative is a huge advantage for video games as an art form and storytelling medium. Since the game mechanics are telling you that the game is ending, you\'re (hopefully) surprised when it doesn\'t. But, within the story, there\'s internal consistency and justification for the twist. I think that makes this sort of feat both easier to pull off and more effective than it would in a novel or a movie, which has fewer tools at its disposal."
