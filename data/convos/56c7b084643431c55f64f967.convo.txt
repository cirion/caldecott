  text: "I\'ve always been mesmerized by underground halls. As a child, I loved reading about Moria, Goblintown, the Tombs of Atuan, Underland, and other vast subterranean spaces. So, it was tremendously exciting to discover Halferville when reading up on the California Free State: one of those classic underground settings, but created by and for the denizens of Shadowrun."

  text: "I wasn\'t able to do justice to the glorious description of Halferville in the source book, particularly its vast scale. An isometric engine can\'t really communicate a high ceiling or a distant wall all that well, and besides, it would be annoying to force someone to walk an enormous distance just to visit the shops. But I tried to nod towards some of its iconic features, including the pillars and the gems left behind in excavated walls."

His concept has evolved and broadened over time; initially he was just the \"hipster bartender dwarf\", but he now has a bit more of a background and motivation."

  text: "Horatio is also the closest I\'ve come to authorial insertion. Not so much in Antumbra Saga, but in The Caldecott Caper, I found that I was often giving him my sentiments to deliver. I would occasionally catch myself thinking something, saying \"That\'s ridiculous!\", then making it ten times as ridiculous and putting it in Horatio\'s mouth."
