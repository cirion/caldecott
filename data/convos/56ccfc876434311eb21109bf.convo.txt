  text: "Most of the maps in this sequence are recycled, so I wanted to make at least one original scene to break that up. I like the look of the manor: in contrast to much of Shadowrun, which is grimy and desperate, this is a place of refinement and elegance. These are the homes of the elite, who profit from the suffering of the masses."

  text: "I had fun with the gameplay here, which is a mixture of light puzzles and pure combat. It\'s arguably better to deliberately start the fight early. That way you can dispose of the guards before Lonestar reinforcements arrive. But most players will probably take the more fun approach and acquire a disguise to approach Ava."

  text: "There were initially two separate disguises you could acquire: either a \"business suit\" or a \"security uniform\". Unfortunately, the Hong Kong engine borked almost all of the disguises, so now all that you can wear are the same Tsang janitor outfits as in the main campaign. People haven\'t complained about that, though, so it probably isn\'t as big of a deal as it seemed to me."
