  text: "And this concludes the second Council dialogue, by far the longest of the entire game. As with the first Council, it carries a lot of narrative weight, explaining your goals for the next four missions. This is also the first time you\'ve gathered all of your crew members together, so it\'s a chance to see how they interact with one another on a personal level."

  text: "A pen-and-paper Shadowrun game consists of a legwork phase and a mission phase. This same approach has generally held for the Harebrained Schemes Shadowrun video games, in a simplified form. You\'ll visit a hub (Seamstress\' Union, Kreuzbasar, or Heoi) to talk with people and buy equipment, then go on a mission where you shoot enemies in their faces."

  text: "That same rhythm generally holds in Caldecott, but at a meta level, the entire game is legwork for the heist. You\'ve been assembling your crew, convincing them to join you, and now are about to collect all the equipment and information you need in order to pull off the job.\n\nThe actual heist itself is pretty short in comparison, but the reason it goes as smoothly as it does is because of the effort you\'ve taken ahead of time to prepare."

  text: "As with the earlier Council, I wanted the player to feel like they\'re in the driver\'s seat. You\'re listening to ideas from your team, following up on them, and ultimately calling the shots about how you\'ll approach the job. The dialogue ends with a rare instance of your PC speaking inside the main dialogue box. I typically avoid putting words in the PC\'s mouth, but this is an effective way to show that you\'re giving orders, not receiving them. Your crew replies to you in the same way that the PC would typically reply to a fixer."

  text: "I think this dialogue is more complicated than it needs to be, but it was originally even worse. I cut a whole tree that dealt with how to divide up the money you earned during your legwork missions. You would decide on a percentage; at the end of each mission, I would calculate how much nuyen you had picked up, then give you your pre-determined share."

  text: "I wonder if I should have also cut out the argument over how to split up the take. I wanted to have some potential conflict within this scene, and that seemed like a logical way to include it. It doesn\'t have any lasting impact, though, and the conversation would definitely still work fine without it.\n\nThat said, the branch is entirely optional. As in real life, sometimes the best solution is to not say anything at all."
