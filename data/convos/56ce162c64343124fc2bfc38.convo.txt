  text: "There really isn\'t a canon answer to that question. The default is the action-movie scenario: Persi is flying nearby, and schedules a rendezvous where she\'ll pick you up from the upper floors and then head on to Ava\'s manor.\n\nHowever, the default scenario is actually fairly unlikely. This can\'t happen if Persi is dying, or if she quit, or if she\'s traveling in your party. And so, there are several fallback options, such as your team rappelling down the side of the building and making your way overland to Pacific Heights, or having Persi call in the aircraft from within the building."

  text: "Maintaining internal continuity is a bit trickier than it might sound. There\'s a difference between the case where Persi isn\'t in your party because you didn\'t bring her along (and thus she\'s available for support), and the case where she isn\'t in your party because she got killed in an earlier fight (and therefore definitely in no condition to operate aircraft). When testing, I\'m always careful to run through the various permutations of world state to make sure that it all makes sense and is internally consistent."

  text: "All of this is hidden from that player, and frankly, I think that\'s a good thing! If you\'re immersed in the story, the outcome should seem like a logical and natural progression to the story. I do get a kick out of thinking that, if someone re-plays the campaign, they might discover that some things which had seemed set in stone are actually quite flexible."
