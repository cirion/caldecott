  text: "Hopefully these monsters didn\'t glitch out on you. I get periodic reports about unusual AI during this encounter, though I\'ve never been able to reproduce the problem. It isn\'t too surprising, though... I don\'t think that these monsters get used in the Hong Kong campaign, and they might not have been tested as thoroughly as others."

  text: "This is one of the only maps in the campaign that has a bit of an exploration focus. I\'m very slow at map-making, so I tend to only make them big enough to accommodate the plot and encounters I have planned. For this scene, though, I really wanted to give the impression of a vast subterranean space, so it\'s larger and less structured than usual.\n\nThere aren\'t huge rewards for exploration, but I scattered around a little nuyen and some alternate solutions to the rock-clearing puzzle."
