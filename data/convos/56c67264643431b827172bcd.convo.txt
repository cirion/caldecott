  text: "I started work on this mod back in January of 2015, when Harebrained Schemes was running the Kickstarter for Hong Kong. I wrote all of the dialogue, then built all of the maps (except the Matrix parts, since HBS had indicated that they would be revisiting Matrix gameplay). I didn\'t start any of the scripting or combat encounters until after Hong Kong was released in August of that year."

  text: "Of course, I took the time to play through Hong Kong before I started the scripting. I had a huge \"Oh, shit!\" moment when I played Whistleblower:\n1. It was another mission set on board a cargo vessel, just like mine.\n2. Their boat looked *much* better than mine.\n3. They had implemented the same stealth mechanics that I had planned on using.\n4. I realized that I wasn\'t having fun when I played through their much-better version of my scene."

  text: "So, I guess I\'m ultimately grateful towards HBS, since otherwise I would have spent a lot more time building out my own stealth mini-game and ending up disappointed at the result. I drastically simplified it in my game, so the guards are stationary and have small fields of vision. That makes the level much shorter and simpler than I had initially planned, but I think it\'s also more fun than my original vision would have been. Cutting features isn\'t always bad, sometimes it makes things better!"
