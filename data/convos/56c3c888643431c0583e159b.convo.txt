  text: "You may have noticed that Kora and Rafik periodically turn to face people as they speak. For example, when Rafik asks you a question, he\'ll turn to face you. When Kora interjects with a new comment, Rafik will look back at her.\n\nThere\'s a fair amount of scripting that went into that: it looks unnatural to have people immediately snap to face a direction on a transition, so there\'s a bit of a delay between when someone \"starts speaking\" and when they move.\n\nI\'m pretty happy with the effect, but it was complex enough that I omitted it for the second Council, which has twice as many participants and jumbled eyelines."

  text: "The Council helps set up yet another of my goals for The Caldecott Caper. I wanted to make the player feel like they are are taking a leadership role, making decisions and guiding their team\'s progress towards their goals. This is a different approach from the Harebrained Schemes games (and most Shadowrun games in general), where the player character is reacting to the demands of a fixer or other authority figure."

  text: "Of course, unlike a pen-and-paper roleplaying game, the player isn\'t ACTUALLY in charge. I put a lot of work into the dialogue flow of the council, hopefully replicating some of the brainstorming and give-and-take that go into the planning phase of a true shadowrun."

  text: "Finally, this was a chance to start introducing the background of the character. This is a slightly unusual situation because the character has access to information that the player does not. You, personally, do not know who Persi is or what happened on Alameda. But the context clues here and elsewhere should give you some of the information you need to fill the details. As usual, I try to provide multiple dialogue choices: you can\'t change the past, but you CAN change how you feel about it."
