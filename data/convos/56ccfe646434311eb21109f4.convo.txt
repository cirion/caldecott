  text: "There\'s a different rhythm to the dialogue in the last portion of the game. You may notice that there are no longer any banters between party members. That\'s mostly because it doesn\'t make as much sense - you\'re in an extremely urgent situation, and it would feel weird to have people chit-chatting. Additionally, some or all of your crew members might be gone, so there may not be much content available."

  text: "In place of that, though, there are longer, meatier exposition chunks, as you uncover the whole story behind the disaster in Halferville. This dialogue with Ava is a great example. There isn\'t as much true player choice in this segment, just because there isn\'t that much left in the game to affect, but there\'s a bit more participation from your crew. They\'ll occasionally interject into the discussion, or speak up when you prompt them. Hopefully this helps maintain the feeling of a coherent and committed team, even in the absence of random banters."
