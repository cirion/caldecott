  text: "With the Native Californians in disarray, there is a power vacuum in Alameda. You don\'t have the manpower to capitalize on it, but someone else does: the Metahuman People\'s Army.\n\nIf you contact them immediately, they will be able to head off further NC incursions on the island. However, this will strengthen the position of Zielor and his affiliated metahuman go-gangs. They have not proven particularly friendly in the past."
