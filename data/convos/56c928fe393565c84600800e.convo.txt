  text: "Alameda is one of the few places where I\'ve deliberately diverged from Shadowrun canon. According to the Neo-Anarchists Guide to North America sourcebook, Alameda is still a military base, under the control of the Imperial Japanese Marines. I think that the real-world version is weirder and more interesting: a decommissioned base which is home to the biggest antiques fair of the Bay Area. Nothing says \"America\" to me quite like the juxtaposition of military power and rampant consumerism."

  text: "This was one of several maps to receive an upgrade after the Shadows of Hong Kong mini-campaign was released. Since most of my maps were built before Hong Kong was released, they mostly rely on props from Dragonfall and Seattle; but I took advantage of many of the latest FX to add some slick new neon and cool water debris."
