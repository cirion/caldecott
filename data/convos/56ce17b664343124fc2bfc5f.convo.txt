  text: "I\'m deliberately vague about her affiliation. Shadowrun experts will pretty quickly be able to figure out that she works for Ares Macrotech, even though she never comes out and says so. Other players probably won\'t know specifically who she\'s allied with, but if they re-play later on, they\'ll re-read some early game dialogue about Ares and hopefully connect the dots. I think that\'s more fun than just spelling everything out explicitly."

  text: "Whenever possible, I try to avoid making cookie-cutter archetypes. Eriana is a Johnson, but far more empathetic and warm than you would expect. She\'s powerful and connected, but also respectful of the progress you\'ve made on your own and the difficulty of your situation."

  text: "Like almost all characters in the game, Eriana is morally ambiguous. She definitely comes across as nicer than Ava, but in the big picture, they\'re playing the same role on different sides. Both work for enormous corporations, carrying out the will of those above them in order to advance their financial interests. Eriana has better people skills, while Ava is more talented at managing projects. Players have no choice in working with Eriana, at least at this point in the game, but they may not choose to trust her."
