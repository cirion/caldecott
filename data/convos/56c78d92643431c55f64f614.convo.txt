  text: "In each of my Shadowrun games, I\'ve included a horror-tinged level. Antumbra had the Site of Power. Eclipse had the Armory. Corona had the Crypt. Those always end up being some of my favorite levels to build: the Shadowrun editor includes terrific resources for creating scary spaces, and I love building a story around those. I don\'t think I could write a full-on horror campaign, but it\'s a fun element to inject into an otherwise-realistic campaign, providing a jolt to the gameplay."
