I\'m delighted that there isn\'t an easy answer here; ideally people have bought into the story enough that they\'ll actually consider and weigh the alternatives, rather than randomly clicking a button to proceed."

  text: "Oh - I haven\'t talked about this much before, but I try to always provide multiple motivations whenever the player has to make a choice. There are multiple schools of thought on this. Some argue that it\'s better to just have a simple \"Yes\" and \"No\" response, and trust that players will come up with their own personal reasons. Personally, though, when I play games I prefer having more color in my dialogue, and really appreciate having the ability to express the reason why I\'m making a choice. Being able to say \"I\'ll do this because it\'s the right thing to do\" versus \"I\'ll do this because you\'re paying me\" versus \"I\'ll do this because I\'m bored\" lets you create some very different player character personalities."

  text: "Incidentally, it\'s even MORE important to offer multiple motivations when you DON\'T offer a choice. In your upcoming dialogue with Eriana, you must accept the mission to destroy Hemlock: the game doesn\'t offer an option where you shrug and go \"Eh, don\'t care.\" That dialogue tree offers an even larger variety of options, in the hopes that every player will be able to find at least one motivation that resonates with them."
