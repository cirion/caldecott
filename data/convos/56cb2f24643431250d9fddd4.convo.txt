  text: "This is one of the few places in the campaign where you can be in combat in meatspace at the same time that a decker is jacked into the Matrix. Unfortunately, there are some new bugs in the Hong Kong engine that make this situation a little wonky. I think I\'ve worked around most of them, but I was glad that I didn\'t have many more scenes like this. They\'re fun to play, but a nightmare to debug."

  text: "Decker is probably my favorite archetype in Shadowrun, and it\'s one of the more unique classes in an RPG; you can\'t play as a hacker in an Elder Scrolls or Dragon Age game, after all. I try to put enough Matrix-y content into my runs so that a decker player character feels useful. Even if your PC isn\'t a decker, if you bring along someone who is, it\'s a nice reminder that we\'re living in a world with cyberspace and other cool science-fiction-y things."

  text: "On the other hand, I generally don\'t want to FORCE you to deck. If you aren\'t playing as a decker, and don\'t like Sable, it would be annoying to always need to lug him around.\n\nThe current mission is the only one (other than the heist) where you\'re required to bring a decker, and because of that, I could put plot-critical information inside the Matrix. In the other runs, you can get some benefit from decking in - spare cash, alternate solutions to challenges, or little lore nuggets - but nothing overwhelmingly powerful."

  text: "One final note: I tried to customize each Matrix node slightly depending on where it\'s located. Most of the random nodes you encounter have stock designs and standard IC. Since Shiawase is a corp node, it\'s much more dangerous. If you trigger the alarm, you\'ll need to deal with an elite decker and black IC. The color scheme inside is different, which may help serve as a warning that you\'re facing a bigger challenge than usual."
