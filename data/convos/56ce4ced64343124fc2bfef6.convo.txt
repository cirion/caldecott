  text: "This is the biggest and most complex non-hub conversation in the game. It\'s almost entirely skippable, if you want to just charge in with guns blazing. But, I think that most players will enjoy exploring alternate outcomes to the scenario, so there\'s a fair amount of choice included, as well as reactivity to earlier actions you\'ve taken."

  text: "There are a bunch of different potential configurations to this multi-stage battle. You always need to fight against Kroin and the HPF: he\'s a fanatic, and cannot be reasoned with. Everything else is up for grabs. You might fight against Kroin and Ava together, then take down Eriana. Or you might fight Kroin alone, then side with Eriana against Ava. Or fight Kroin, and end in a 3-way firefight with Ava and Eriana."

  text: "There is a LOT of scripting to keep track of different fight configurations and, more importantly, victory conditions. It would be a huge pain to need to complete each fight in order to test the logic, so I used my standard \"debug triggers\" extensively in this scene. While I\'m in debug mode, I can wipe out a team by just clicking on an invisible block, which lets me check the conditions easily and iterate until they\'re working correctly."

  text: "One wild-card in this encounter is what will happen with Ava. She\'ll withdraw from the first stage of the fight if you just ask her to. However, whether she *stays* out of the fight is another question. As with Zielor, this is mostly based on how much she trusts you. Unlike Zielor, though, you aren\'t \"locked out\" of the choice based on your prior actions."

  text: "Ava has her own approval system, similar to your companions. Unlike them, though, you don\'t see an on-screen indication of when you gain or lose favor. At the start of this encounter, her favor is based on your prior actions: did you sink the Shiawase vessel? Did you destroy her lab? This is modified over the course of your conversation with her and Kroin. She likes it when you express support for her position, and dislikes it if you berate her or negotiate with Kroin.\n\nThe ultimate effect is that, while your prior actions will make it easier to ally with Ava, it\'s still possible to ally with her even if you made the \"wrong\" decisions, and it\'s also possible that she might betray you even if you made the \"right\" decisions. This kind of dynamism is difficult, so I don\'t use it too often, but it felt appropriate for the climax of the game."

  text: "You end up with one of three big-picture outcomes to the encounter that will carry over to the final epilogue. There\'s the \"everyone dies\" outcome, where you wipe out Ares and Shiawase and destroy all Hemlock. There\'s the \"support Eriana\" outcome, where Ares takes control of Hemlock and Shiawase is diminished. The third, and most difficult, outcome is \"support Ava\", where you destroy Hemlock but spare Ava."

  text: "That third ending is the most difficult, but, as usual, that doesn\'t necessarily mean that it\'s the best. You\'ll need to think about your runner\'s personal moral compass, how important vengeance is to you, how much you trust Ava, and the feelings of your crew. I expect that few players will end up with this option, but it\'s a fun, semi-hidden alternate outcome that some people might discover if they subsequently replay the campaign."
