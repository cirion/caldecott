  text: "The simplest form is an \"interrogation node\". This is where you get a menu of questions to ask: \"What is your name?\" \"What is your job?\" \"Who is Keyser Soze?\" Stuff life that. These are really good ways to provide players with important plot information, or with additional background lore for flavor. But, it isn\'t all that interesting to play through. Too many modern RPGs rely completely on this sort of \"dialogue\", which just requires you to click on every single prompt until they\'re all exhausted. That removes the \"role-playing\" aspect of the game, so I try to avoid leaning on it too much."

  text: "Sometimes, you get true \"choice nodes\". These will have consequences, which might range from the minor (Rafik likes you a little more!) to the major (Zielor is dead!). Everyone loves these sorts of dialogues, since it feels like your player is having a major impact on the world around them. But, they can be extremely time-consuming to create, especially if they lead to branching plot lines. I\'m fairly liberal with favor-based choice nodes, but otherwise try to restrict myself to a couple of choice nodes per mission."

  text: "The last major type of dialogue component I use is what I call a \"reaction node\". This is when the other person makes a statement or asks a question, and you need to reply to them. These only have a short-term impact. The other person will probably say something different depending on your own statement, but it won\'t have lasting repercussions. Unlike true choice nodes, these are fairly quick to write, and they\'re also a *great* way to establish a player character\'s personality, as well as how they relate to other characters in the game."

  text: "I tried to make sure that each reaction node would have at least three distinct voices available. That\'s kind of a sweet spot for me. Two choices tends to degenerate into boring good/evil options. Four or more is better, but doesn\'t add much more variety; I\'d rather spend the time writing longer dialogues with more opportunities for reaction than shorter dialogues with more choices."
