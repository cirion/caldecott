  text: "Kora is the first of two \"secret companions\" you can recruit. Actually, she\'s a companion you MUST recruit. If you ticked off your entire team, then everyone might have quit except for the person who died. Kora joins your team so that, no matter what happens to the rest of the crew, I can count on at least one person being around to deliver plot-critical information."

  text: "I love the thematic role that Kora plays in the plot. In much the same way that Kroin seemed like a background character, who abruptly transforms into a villain, so Kora seems like a background NPC as well, until the moment she grabs an uzi and starts shooting. But, as with Kroin, there\'s a narrative reason for her evolution. She and Rafik have been saving money for a long time, hoping for an operation to repair her legs; now that the score was successful, they\'ve gotten their wish, and she\'s in a position to help you out."
