  text: "You may notice that the guards here are wearing proper Shiawase uniforms! That was one of the nicest surprises of the Shadows of Hong Kong expansion for the Extended Edition: the Shiawase underwater lab included some great 3D models for Shiawase security, complete with tiny little Shiawase logos. I grabbed those for many of the corpsec scenes of the game, replacing the Tsang security models I was using before."

  text: "The only downside is that the Shiawase models don\'t look quite as imposing... they have lighter armor, are a bit smaller, and don\'t seem so menacing. Still, I think it\'s a nice improvement, and also helps keep internal lore consistent between the official campaigns and my own."

  text: "Speaking of which... it was a bit wild to play through SoHK and realize that they ALSO had a plot about Shiawase developing a bioweapon. I was initially a bit worried, since I thought new players might come into this campaign with that association and be prepared for the reveal of Hemlock. I\'m now pretty happy with it, though, for the aforementioned consistency. Not to say that Shiawase *always* manufactures horrific bioweapons, but it\'s been hinted at a few times in the source books, and I\'m now happier at the idea of players making that connection."
