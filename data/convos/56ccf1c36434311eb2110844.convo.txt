  text: "Sable\'s Matrix sequence may not seem that complex, but it ended up being the most challenging part of the heist to script. It\'s very different from a standard Matrix interaction, where you manually jack in while a mission is underway. I had to add some custom dialogue to explain what was happening, clear scene goals to keep players from jacking out prematurely, and many scripts to make sure that you could actually finish the heist without getting into an invalid state."

  text: "It all works now, but it\'s one of those parts of the campaign that I always keep a nervous eye on. Any time that a user-created mod does something which isn\'t part of the official Harebrained Schemes campaigns, there\'s a high risk that future updates to the game engine will break it. I\'ve been lucky so far, and really hope that this continues to work!"
