  text: "This is a little one-off map specifically for this encounter. I\'d originally planned to allow you to revisit it later on. If you saved the orks, you could speak with the family inside. Otherwise, it would be empty.\n\nI couldn\'t think of anything interesting to do with it, though, so I ended up locking players out. Otherwise, obsessive players like myself would feel like they needed to trek all the way out here on every single visit, even when there was nothing new to do."

  text: "As a modder, I don\'t have access to any analytics data, and I always wonder about how many people choose alternate outcomes. The \"best\" choice here is to save the ork, of course, and it\'s pretty hard to kill him. But, there\'s an alternate plot line where you confront his father after the son dies. I\'m really curious how many people end up playing through that \"bad\" ending."

  text: "Broadly speaking, that\'s one of the bigger decisions I always need to make: how much time do I want to put into multiple outcomes? As players, we always think that more is better. But, each ending takes time, and if I have fewer endings I\'ll have more time to create additional situations that everyone can play through."

  text: "Ultimately, I think that there\'s a lot of value in having multiple choices, even if only a tiny fraction of players ever choose it. If 90% of people will choose the \"good\" outcome, it\'s tempting to only offer the \"good\" path; but by making it a choice, it becomes more meaningful to players. They\'re making an active decision and it becomes a part of their personal story, rather than something the developer has told them."
