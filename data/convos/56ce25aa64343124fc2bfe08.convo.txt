  text: "If you\'ve elected to save your partner, you\'ve been rewarded with a decently-long reunion scene, as well as some karma. The delayed karma reward was a deliberately nasty decision on my part. I love the idea of someone saving before that conversation with Eriana, reloading to figure out the different outcomes, and realizing that they get a massive Karma boost from sacrificing the cure. If you\'re patient and carry out the cure, you still earn most of that Karma, but munchkin gamers will have to choose between getting a better in-game benefit and a happier story."

  text: "The romance variation of this scene was probably my favorite scene to write in the entire game. I general try not to be sappy, but I think that you\'ve earned a little emotion by this point.\n\nI wrote this not too long after reading an interesting article in the New York Times by Mandy Len Catron, titled \"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This\". I haven\'t tried it myself, but it sounded fascinating, and I suspected that some of its power could survive the translation into a video-game medium.\n\nThe line about the two of you being \"in on the same joke\" is a quote, although I\'ve unfortunately forgotten the original source. My dad used it to describe his parents\' relationship, and the phrase has always stuck with me."

  text: "I\'m pretty happy that the culmination of the romance isn\'t a sex scene, but an \"in sickness and in health\" commitment. I think it\'s a better reflection of real-world relationships, where passion provides the early burst of energy, but intimacy and commitment make it last. It also opens up your character\'s personal story: it\'s easier to imagine a future with their partner, as opposed to a one-night-stand in their past."

  text: "Of course, none of this applies if you haven\'t been pursuing a romance, and applies even less if you sacrificed the Hemlock victim for the greater good. You miss out on this dramatic scene, but open up lots of shorter dialogue snippets elsewhere as people acknowledge the tough decision you made.\n\nAgain, I want to avoid offering a clear \"right\" and \"wrong\" answer. Your morality may demand that you pursue the greater good, which pushes you into a more melancholy version of the story, but for you, that version will resonate more strongly than a forced (or easy) \"happy\" version would."
