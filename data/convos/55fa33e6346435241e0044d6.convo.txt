  text: "Another placeholder. Points to cover:\n* Thanks for the rescue!\n* NC forced him to turn over the train engine, but were going to kill him anyways.\n* (Probably some speculation here with their links to Saito and the eventual use of the engine.)\n* They took the keycard into the bunker. That\'s where the lockdown controls are.\n* If you hurry, you can catch them! you\'re welcome to keep the engine if you can release it from lockdown - he wants to make alameda less valuable to the NCs."
