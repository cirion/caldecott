  text: "Unlike the Gauntlet, which was vaguely modeled off of a neighborhood, this has a more specific location: the Dogpatch neighborhood in San Francisco, specifically along 3rd street from about  19th-17th street. The Shadowrun tile sets gave some great tools for approximating the feel of the neighborhood.\n\nIt\'s been simplified, of course. I learned the hard way not to go overboard in translating a location to a game: the Mission District in Antumbra Saga was a fairly detailed depiction of Mission and Valencia from about 14th-16th street, and ended up feeling pretty clunky. For this map, I focused on just a few elements: the pier, the intersection, warehouses, newer office buildings."

  text: "City scenes are time-consuming to make, and I cheated a bit on this one by grabbing some buildings from Dragonfall to help populate the skyline. I\'ve gotten better at blocking out inaccessible areas and using \"block vision\" elements to limit players\' sights, which lets me focus on developing a small area without having maps abruptly end at their edges. There isn\'t as much exploration in this map as you would get in a place like the Walled City, but I think it does an okay job at depicting an urban environment for story purposes."

  text: "Speaking of which: you\'ll note the contrast between the Gauntlet and here. We\'re in prime megacorp territory, so graffiti and flaming garbage cans would seem out of place. That does mean giving up some of my favorite tools for adding character, but I do get to take advantage of neon signage and some rare green grass."
