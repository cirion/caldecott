  text: "Whenever possible, I try to make sure that a gameplay choice will have both mechanical and cosmetic repercussions. In the case of Dorbi\'s election, she\'s happier if she wins and you can get more favor from her. If she loses, you get a small payout from Kroin.\n\nIn addition, though, you\'ll unlock different dialogue throughout the course of the game, as well as see her appear in different locations. Hopefully, those changes make players feel like their actions have had a stronger impact on the world."
