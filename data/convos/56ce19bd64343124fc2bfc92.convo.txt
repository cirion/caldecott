  text: "Later in the game, I have more fun with setting up ambushes: areas that are clear when you initially visit, but are filled with enemies upon your return. Cautious players will feel rewarded for their paranoia, and people who rush ahead will feel more like this is a dynamic and unpredictable world, not just a chess board with every piece set."

  text: "Claude is the last piece in the \"everything is connected\" plot. Back at the Halferville party, all you knew was that something was going on with Shiawase and the HPF. You\'ve fought against both of those factions before, and may not have expected to see them again. Likewise, the Native Californians have been a part of the story since Sable\'s recruitment mission, but may not have seemed to tie in to anything else going on."

The NCs, and their sponsor Saito, want a solution to the \"trog problem\". Shiawase will gladly research and develop that solution for a profit. And the HPF has helped test it. Each faction may have different motives, but they\'re all involved in advancing this threat."

  text: "One major storytelling problem I need to deal with early on is to decide just how much flexibility to give the player character in how they relate with other major NPCs. Should you have the option to *not* recruit crew members? Can you turn down a run from a Johnson? It usually feels good to give players more agency, but in a CRPG, you need to fully write out each possible variation, and so it\'s better to pick a few of the most compelling alternatives and fully develop them. (As opposed to, say, deciding to not walk down an alley in the first scene and immediately see GAME OVER.)"

  text: "Villains pose another challenge. Should you allow the player to side with them? I have a ton of respect for Harebrained Schemes, who actually added a major variation in the Director\'s Cut of Dragonfall, adding a (dark!) alternate path wherein you join Vauclair.\n\nThere are a few similar opportunities in The Caldecott Caper, where you can express sympathy for a foe or (in some cases) even join forces with them. At the end of the day, though, I just didn\'t want to write pro-racist dialogue for the player character, so there\'s no similar option for teaming with Claude."

  text: "One of the more obscure options in Antumbra Saga does allow you to sort-of team with Claude. The option only appears if you\'re a human, and even then you need to do some awful stuff, including killing a recruitable NPC. Ultimately, though, Claude just doesn\'t want to make friends. Because of your associations, he fundamentally distrusts anything you may say or offer. No matter what your character does, Claude will continue being a bad guy and fighting against you.\n\nHopefully, that all makes sense within the context of the story. It can feel frustrating if it seems like an option is being arbitrarily withheld, but I stress Claude\'s extremism enough that it shouldn\'t be surprising that you can\'t become BFFs."
