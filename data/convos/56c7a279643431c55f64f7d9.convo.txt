Various decisions you made over the course of the game would increase your base\'s manpower and/or supply levels. When you returned to the base after each mission, you would see how the base had expanded in reaction to its new resources."

  text: "I was really proud of how the system worked. It was a way to make sure that every decision the player made mattered, since it impacted your army\'s composition for the final battle and the final epilogue you received; at the same time, no single decision would determine the outcome, so there was still narrative freedom. I was convinced that it was the best new feature in Corona."

  text: "After mulling over it, I realized that it was because there was no clear in-game link between cause and effect. As the designer, I knew which actions were updating behind-the-scenes variables, and how those variables were affecting future events. Players don\'t see any of that, though. They make decisions, and something happens, but they don\'t know that the outcome resulted from the decision. The same loose association that I had thought was a cool asset was actually a negative."

Dogs don\'t just appear in Halferville: you learn that they\'re the same dogs you rescued earlier. Streez\'s pals will talk about whether you killed or saved him. You\'ll hear from victims or clients of the smugglers at the Port of Oakland."

Most choices are independent of one another, so I avoided the headache of deeply-nested branching plot lines. And, as players, you receive periodic acknowledgement of the impact you\'re having on the world."

  text: "This whole experience has reminded me of a quote I heard, attributed to the great Sid Meier: \"In some games, the player is having fun; in others, the designer is having fun; in others, the system is having fun.\" It\'s really easy for me as a designer to get caught up in what I\'m building, excited about its elegance. The main focus, though, should always be on the person on the other side of the keyboard. I like to think that I\'ve gotten better at asking myself \"Yes, but is this FUN?\" whenever I\'m contemplating a new feature."
