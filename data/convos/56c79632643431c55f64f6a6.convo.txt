  text: "Map creation has significant trade-offs. As a player, I like it when each level has a unique map. As a creator, I can make more levels if I re-use maps. I try to strike a balance, recycling maps when it makes sense and not too often.\n\nOutdoor maps like the Gauntlet are the most time-consuming for me to make, and it\'s easier for me to justify investing that effort if I know that I\'ll get more mileage out of it."

  text: "There are a few simple things I can do that can help alter the feel of a map: different lighting, music, weather, and inhabitants all make it seem more fresh. Still, I try to keep recycling to a minimum, so no map in this campaign gets used more than twice, and fewer than half of the maps get recycled at all."
