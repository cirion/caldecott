  text: "Hiya! This is just a placeholder. It should establish the following:\n* The market is usually bustling, but the NC has started attacking. The MPA will eventually move in to try and reclaim.\n* Yes, there is a train engine here.\n* Caleb keeps it locked down - brings in bulk cargo from jack london cube. \n* NCs trying to take the engine - probably to ship in more weapons, but maybe to help saito bus out metahumans. (this might be info from caleb.)\n\n* When you say \"Goodbye\", NCs attack. Proceed."
