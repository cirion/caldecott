  text: "Saito received a lot of build-up in the Saga, and I had initially thought that he would be the main villain of my next campaign. However, the timeline doesn\'t work well for that. Saito is one of the more notorious enemies of the Shadowrun universe, and he\'s really just getting started: he won\'t even seize power until 2061. He wouldn\'t be a very satisfying villain if you couldn\'t defeat him, and I didn\'t want to jump all the way ahead to the late 2060s. So, I ended up integrating him to the story, while removing him from the focus."
