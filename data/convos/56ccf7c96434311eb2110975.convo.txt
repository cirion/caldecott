  text: "I don\'t have a very clear memory of how and when I came up with the idea for Ava. I think that it was at least partially because I wanted more diversity among my villains. Antumbra Saga\'s villains were either men (Shavarus, Claude, Hans) or non-gendered (Spirit, Tophet). I hadn\'t had an elf or a woman as a villain before, so it was a fun challenge to figure her out. The source material described how, despite Japan\'s strict anti-metahuman policies, megacorps would regularly import talented elves into the higher levels of their businesses, and those protected metas would have immunity from Saito\'s laws. Ava is in an interesting dynamic, since she feels no affinity for other metahumans who lack the privileges she has accumulated."
